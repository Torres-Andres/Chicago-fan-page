            <h2>Why I like Chicago</h2>
            <p>I like to think of Chicago as my family in a way. We have our ups and downs but at the end of the day im still here. Chicago has never really done me any bad/good. I guess one can describe my relationship with Chicago as neutral. People say Chicago is a violent city, and it is true, but that mostly depends what part you are in.</p>
